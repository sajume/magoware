MAGOWARE is an IPTV/OTT solution for Pay Tv Businesses. The administration portal is build on Sequelize, Express, ng-admin, and Node.js

### Installation

### Before you start, make sure you have these prerequisites installed:

 * PostgreSQL 9.4 or MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and MSSQL (If using Mysql please use v-5.7.31)
 * Redis Server
 * Node.js 10.0.0 and up

### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration, change the NODE_ENV variable at server.js and star the server with:

```bash
$ npm start
```

* explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options
### Starting in development mode
```bash
$ npm start
```
or
```bash
$ node server.js
```
### Running with TLS (SSL)
Application will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:

```bash
$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh
```

### Database migration

$ sequelize migration:create  # Generates a new migration file.


To upgrade the database with the latest changes run the following:

```bash
$ sequelize db:migrate
```


* explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options

### Running with TLS (SSL)
Application will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:

```bash
$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh
```

Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).
After you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.

Finally, execute grunt's prod task `grunt prod`
* enable/disable SSL mode in production environment change the `secure` option in `config/env/production.js`
